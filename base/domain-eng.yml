        *Here are your HealthCheck results.*

        *Based on your answers, we suggest that you use HealthCheck for the next few days to check your symptoms.*

        If you had contact with someone with COVID-19 AND you said yes to any of the symptoms questions, you may be eligible for testing to find out if you are infected with COVID-19.

        Call the COVID-19 Hotline: 0800029999, or your healthcare practitioner, for what to do next and how and where to get tested if advised to do so

        *Should I isolate/quarantine if I have not been tested?*
        You do not need to self-isolate if you have not been tested. If you test and your test comes back positive and you have symptoms, self-siolate for 7 days.

        *What if I came into contact with someone who tested positive?*
        You do not need to isolate if you had close contact with someone with COVID-19. Watch out for symptoms (you can use HealthCheck). If you develop symptoms, see a healthcare practitioner. 

        Self-isolation guidelines:
        - Avoid contact with others.
        - Stay home. Only go out for medical care.
        - Track your *SYMPTOMS*.
        - Get medical attention if you become ill.
        - Know how to get care.
