        *Based on your responses, we recommend that you self-quarantine for the next 14 days and complete this HealthCheck daily to self monitor your symptoms.*

        If possible, stay and sleep alone in a room that has a window with good air flowing through.
        - You can talk to other family members and go outside, but you should stay at least 2 meters away from everyone at all times.
        - You should not have visitors at your house during this time.
        - One family member should be assigned as your caregiver. This exposes less of your family and also ensures that you and this caregiver can develop good habits so that they do not catch the virus from you.
        - If these procedures are not possible, you should contact your health care worker or clinic for alternative options.

        *Based on your responses, you may be eligible for testing to find out if you are infected with COVID-19.*

        Call the COVID-19 Hotline: 0800029999, or your healthcare practitioner, for further information on what to do next, how and where to get tested if advised to do so.

        Follow these important steps when seeking care:
        - Avoid contact with other people in your household and your community, if possible, stay in a separate room.
        - Ensure you put on a face mask before you enter a healthcare facility.

        If you have or start getting severe symptoms, seek medical care urgently.

# TODO: I'm assuming that the way this will be solved is that we'll send a message to

# The other option is to make this a custom action that gets triggered, and our actions

# We need the conversation claim ID, and the message ID, to be able to make the correct
