        Well done for taking the risk assessment. Stay safe and continue to monitor your health.

        *Based on your responses, we recommend that you self-quarantine for the next 10 days and complete this HealthCheck every day to monitor your symptoms.*

        If possible, stay and sleep alone in a room that has a window with good air flowing through.
        - You can talk to other family members and go outside, but you should stay at least 2 meters away from everyone at all times.
        - You should not have visitors at your house during this time.
        - One family member should be assigned as your caregiver. This exposes less of your family and also ensures that you and this caregiver can develop good habits so that they do not catch the virus from you.
        - If these procedures are not possible, you should contact your health care worker or clinic for alternative options.

        Well done for taking the risk assessment on behalf of [Child's name]. Stay safe and continue to monitor their health.

        *Based on {obo_name}'s responses, we recommend that they self-quarantine for the next 10 days and complete this HealthCheck daily to self monitor their symptoms.*

        If possible, they should stay and sleep alone in a room that has a window with good air flowing through.
        - They can talk to other family members and go outside, but should stay at least 2 meters away from everyone at all times.
        - They should not have visitors at the house during this time.
        - One family member should be assigned as their caregiver. This exposes less of your family and also ensures that [child's name] and the caregiver can develop good habits so that they do not catch the virus from them.
        - If these procedures are not possible, please contact your health care worker or clinic for alternative options.
